<h2><a name="What_is_the_Disruptor?"></a>What is the Disruptor?<a href="http://code.google.com/p/disruptor/#What_is_the_Disruptor?" class="section_anchor"></a></h2><p><a href="http://www.lmaxtrader.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">LMAX</a> aims to be the fastest trading platform in the world.  Clearly, in order to achieve this we needed to do something special to achieve very low-latency and high-throughput with our Java platform. Performance testing showed that using queues to pass data between stages of the system was introducing latency, so we focused on optimising this area. </p><p>The Disruptor is the result of our research and testing.  We found that cache misses at the CPU-level, and locks requiring kernel arbitration are both extremely costly, so we created a framework which has "mechanical sympathy" for the hardware it's running on, and that's lock-free. </p>
