<p>Few things about your PC are as boring as things that just work,
invisible in the background. Interrupt balancing is one of those things, and
even though it falls in this boring category, the Linux application that is
in charge of this functionality was long overdue in getting a major
overhaul. Intel rose to this task, and this article describes the goals,
gains, and result. </p><h4>What is Interrupt Balancing?</h4>

<p>In order to
explain what interrupt balancing is for, I need to first explain the
following picture.
</p><p>
<img style="width: 534px; height: 462px;" src="image1.png" alt="">
</p>

<p>The picture shows a simplified schematic of a dual socket, quad core
server with 2 disks and 2 network controllers. These 4 devices each have an
interrupt line to the chipset. This interrupt line is used by the device to
inform the system that they would like the attention of the operating
system; for example, because a network packet came in, or because the disk
has the data ready that the operating system asked for. The chipset then has
the task to forward this interrupt to a specific core in one of the 2
sockets. The core in question will then invoke a part of the operating
system that will deal with the device (by accepting the packet and then
passing it on to the TCP/IP protocol stack for example). Intel chipsets (and
similar chipsets from other vendors) use something akin to a table (it's
programmed into a component called IO-APIC) for this, and this
"table" maps specific interrupts to specific cores or sets of
cores. The standard table in our hardware effectively maps all interrupts to
core 1 of the first socket. While this works, it also means that under high
utilization (for example, on a really busy network) this core gets to spend
a disproportional amount of work on processing the interrupts. </p>

<p>It is
the task of the interrupt balancing software to distribute this workload
more evenly across the cores: to determine which interrupts should go to
which core, and then fill this table for the chipset to use. </p><h4>Naive
balancing</h4>

<p>A simple, naive way to solve the "one core gets to do
all the work" problem is just to give the interrupts from the first
device to core 1, the second one to core 2 and so on. However... this still
can give problems: core 1 and core 2 share their cache in Intel's Quad
Core processors and even share the link to the chipset (called FSB or Front
Side Bus). Now interrupt 1 and 2 are from the network cards; if there is a
lot of network traffic, the shared cache gets disproportionally burdened, as
is the shared FSB bus. A much better distribution for this scenario would be
to put the first network card on the first core of the leftmost socket, but
the second network card on the first core of the rightmost socket. This
example shows that something smarter than just a very naive method is needed
to get a fair and performing distribution. Another aspect is that servers
tend to be used in different ways over time: for example, while during
business hours a server might be mostly using the network, at night it might
be crunching on the daily report and using its disks. Both scenarios will
have a different optimal interrupt distribution.X</p><h4>Power meets
Performance</h4>

<p>In the previous section, a distribution was presented
where each of the network cards sends their respective interrupts to a
separate socket. Under a high network load, this will yield optimal fairness
and highest performance. However, when network load is more moderate, and
the system otherwise mostly idle, this means that both sockets get
interrupts all the time (although at a moderate rate). This in turn means
that both sockets get taken out of their power saving sleep modes: the fair
distribution makes the processors use more power than would have been needed
if the distribution was different! </p>

<p>A smart interrupt balancing
program is capable of detecting when performance is paramount as well as
detecting when it's not, and adjusting the interrupt distribution
dynamically based on this. In addition, a smart interrupt balancing program
is aware of which resources (cache, FSB, etc.) are shared by which cores,
and tries to avoid bottlenecks on all of them. </p>

<p>The current Linux
irqbalance program is several years old in design, and is blissfully unaware
of the ideas of Quad (or even Dual) core or even power usage. The program is
conceptually closer to the naive balancing than to the smart interrupt
balancer. </p><h4>The new irqbalance</h4>

<p>As a first step, irqbalance
collects the topology of the processors in the system, and creates a tree
that represents packages, cache domains, and cores. In this context, a
package is the "socket" and a cache domain is the set of cores in
a socket that share the largest level cache. For the system that was shown
earlier, this tree looks like this:</p><img src="image2.png" alt=""> 

<p>As the second step, the new irqbalance
program assigns each interrupt source in the system to a "class."
A class is a type of device, for example: Networking, Storage, Media,
Legacy, or Timer. This classification allows irqbalance to apply different
strategies to the interrupts of each of these classes. In addition to this
class, irqbalance keeps trackXfor each interruptXwhich core or cores it was
assigned to previously, which cores are close to the interrupt in a NUMA
system, and what the rate of interrupts is that comes in. This interrupt
rate is used as a proxy for the amount of work that is needed to service the
device behind the interrupt. </p>

<p>Once all this data is collected, one
final step is taken: irqbalance checks the system load statistics that Linux
exports and in specific, it collects the amount of time spent that is
reported to have been spent on servicing interrupts. If this amount of time
spent on interrupts is low for some time, irqbalance decides to switch to
power save mode, while if the amount of time spent is over some threshold,
irqbalance will switch to performance mode. </p>

<p>With the
power-or-performance mode selected, irqbalance has all the information it
needs to start assigning the interrupts to cores. Irqbalance will start with
the Networking class of interrupts, and then goes to the Storage class, and
so on. This order is based on the performance sensitivity priority of these
classes of interrupts. Within the class, the interrupt that has the highest
activity rate is handled first. </p>

<p>As a first step, the interrupts are
assigned to packages. In power save mode, all interrupts are assigned to the
first package (to allow the other packages to stay in their respective sleep
states longer), while in performance mode, irqbalance tries to spread the
interrupts over the available packages as much as possible such that the
cumulative amount of work that each package will do is made equal as much as
possible. In addition, in performance mode, irqbalance will always
distribute interrupts of the same class to different packages as long as
there are not more interrupts in the class than there are packages. This is
done to prevent one networking (or storage) interrupt from interfering with
another interrupt in the same class via the sharing of resources that goes
with being assigned to the same package. To make things even more complex,
irqbalance also takes into account which package the interrupt was already
assigned to previously and will try to keep the interrupt assigned to the
same package (since there might be valuable data in the cache there already
for the device). It also takes into account which packages are directly
connected to the hardware in a NUMA system (since using a core with such a
direct connection is going to be faster than using a core which has an
indirect connection). </p>

<p>Once each interrupt is assigned to a package,
the next step is to divide these interrupts up over the cache domains that
are part of this package. This step is very similar to the previous step in
that in this step the previous placements and NUMA affinity are taken
account again. And just as with packages, an attempt is made to avoid
getting same-class interrupts assigned to the same cache domain. However
power-save mode is not taken into account since there are no power
efficiencies to be gained by avoiding work in only parts of a package.
</p>

<p>For the Networking interrupt class, it is essential that the
interrupt goes to one and one core only. The implementation of the Linux
TCP/IP stack will then use this property to get some major efficiencies in
its operation. In addition, if an interrupt source of another class is very
high rate, irqbalance will also assign this to a specific core in order to
maximize the efficiency of the level 1 cache of this core. This assigning to
the cores uses the same algorithm as the assignment to cache-domains.
</p>

<p>For the hypothetical system that was shown before, the placement
algorithm would have decided on the distribution as shown in the picture
below: </p><img src="image3.png" alt=""> 

<p>Each of the 2 networking cards is assigned to a specific
core in a different package, while the storage devices have their interrupts
assigned also to separate packages, but within each package to another cache
domain than the respective network controller is assigned to. The storage
controllers will have their interrupt assigned to both cores in their
respective cache domain; in the example I have assumed that the workloads
that are caused by these storage adapters is below the threshold to trigger
a direct assignment to a core and that the system is busy enough to use
performance mode. </p>

<p>In power save mode, the distribution would have
looked like this picture instead: </p><img src="image4.png" alt=""> 

<p>Here all interrupts are assigned to
the first package, and each cache domain has a storage device and a
networking device assigned to it. Each network device is then also
specifically assigned to one core within its cache domain. </p>
