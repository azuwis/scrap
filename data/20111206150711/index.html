<p>
This tutorial explains how to share a Git repository among developers.
It is meant for small teams who are adopting Git for the first time, and
want to get started quickly with a familiar setup before exploring Git's
many new possibilities.

</p><p>
If you follow this route, you will end up with a single centrally-hosted
repository that everyone in your group can use to publish their own work
and fetch whatever others have published. People used to a centralised
VCS will find this model easy to adjust to, but of course, each user's
"working copy" will itself be a fully-fledged Git repository, and many
new workflows are available to users as they learn more.

</p><p>
It would help if you're familiar with basic Git terminology and usage,
but if not, you can skim through to find out which commands you need to
read about and experiment with. (I recommend
<a href="http://ftp.newartisans.com/pub/git.from.bottom.up.pdf">Git from the bottom up</a>
and the
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gittutorial.html">Git tutorial</a>
for an introduction.) I shall assume that everyone has git 1.6.5 or
later installed, and that they have ssh access to the server that will
host the repository.

</p><h2>Repository setup</h2>

<p>
In the ideal case, you create a repository on the server, clone it on
each workstation, and are ready to start work. That happy situation is
described below, as well as the all-too-likely addition of an existing
repository into the picture.

</p><h3>On the server</h3>

<p>
Use <code>git init</code> to create a new repository. The easy way to
give people read-write access to it is to add all the relevant users to
one group (say <code>dev</code>), and give that group ownership of the
repository:

</p><pre class="excerpt">$ git init --bare --shared foo.git
Initialized empty shared Git repository in /git/foo.git/
$ chgrp -R dev foo.git
</pre>

<p>
It doesn't matter what user you run this command as. The
<code>--shared</code> option sets the permissions on everything in the
repository to group-writable.

</p><p>
Let's say the server is named <code>example.org</code>, and the new
repository lives in the <code>/git/foo.git</code> directory. To anyone
with ssh access to the server, the repository is now available at
<code>ssh://example.org/git/foo.git</code>.

</p><h3>Importing an existing repository</h3>

<p>
This can be done in many ways. My advice is to set up the new repository
on the server, push everything from the old repository into it, and
forget about the old repository.

</p><pre class="excerpt">$ cd existing.git
$ git push ssh://example.org/git/foo.git '*:*'
Counting objects: 3, done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 204 bytes, done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
Unpacking objects: 100% (3/3), done.
To ssh://example.org/git/foo.git
 * [new branch]      master -&gt; master
</pre>

<p>
The output above is from a test repository with a single commit. The
<code>*:*</code> notation pushes everything, including tags and remote
branches. If that's not what you want, use a more specific notation and
multiple pushes; or just get rid of any branches, remotes, or tags you
don't want before you push everything. There are many complications
possible at this step, but discussing them is not within the scope of
this article.

</p><p>
(Why forget about the old repository? It's just simpler that way, but if
you really want, you can configure it to pretend that it's just another
clone of the new repository.)

</p><h3>On the clients</h3>

<p>
Each user can now create their own copy of the central repository:

</p><pre class="excerpt">$ git clone ssh://example.org/git/foo.git
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/ams/foo/.git/
</pre>

<p>
This clone is now configured to <em>track</em> the central repository,
which means that <code>git pull</code> will pull any commits from it
that you don't have already, and <code>git push</code> will push any
new commits back to it. The next sections explain how this works.

</p><p>
(Note: You'll see a warning about having cloned an empty repository if
you didn't push anything into <code>foo.git</code>. There's no problem
with starting from scratch, but you need to remember that the very first
push back to the central repository is special. More about that later.)

</p><p>
Let's pretend the original repository looks like the following diagram.
The dots are commits, and there are two branches named
<code>master</code> and <code>other</code>:

</p><p>

</p><h2>Pushing and pulling</h2>

<p>
The newly-cloned repositories can refer to the central repository as
"origin", which is just a handy alias for the full <code>ssh://</code>
URL. During the initial cloning operation, any branches that exist in
the origin repository are saved as "remote branches" in the clone. A
branch named <code>x</code> in origin would be named
<code>remotes/origin/x</code> on the clone. Remote branches are meant to
represent the state of a remote repository, so you shouldn't commit to
them directly.

</p><p>
<img src="clone.png" alt="Diagram of state of clone">

</p><p>
Instead, you should create a local branch that follows or tracks any
remote branch you're interested in; and this is done automatically for
the default branch, conventionally named <code>master</code>. After the
clone, you will have a remote branch named
<code>remotes/origin/master</code>, and a local branch named
<code>master</code>, which is checked out already. The former represents
the latest commit in origin. The latter follows along, but will include
your own local commits too.

</p><p>
<img src="commit.png" alt="Diagram of state after commit">

</p><p>
When you <code>git commit</code>, your <code>master</code> branch is
updated to point to the new commit. When you <code>git push</code>, your
<code>master</code> is used to update origin's <code>master</code>.
When you <code>git pull</code>, origin's <code>master</code> is used
to update your <code>remotes/origin/master</code> branch, which in turn
is used to update your own <code>master</code> branch.

</p><p>
<img src="synced.png" alt="Diagram of state after pull">

</p><h3>Other people's changes</h3>

<p>
When multiple people push commits to a shared origin, the update process
involves an extra step. Suppose you push a commit while a colleague
creates a new local commit of her own. When she tries to <code>git
push</code>, the server rejects the push so as to not lose your commit
(which she doesn't have). She must then run <code>git pull</code>, which
will first update her <code>origin/master</code> remote branch to
include your commit, then merge it into her <code>master</code> so that
it includes both her commit and yours.

</p><p>
<img src="merging.png" alt="Diagram of state after merge">

</p><p>
Her next <code>git push</code> will push the merged branch to origin. If
you run <code>git pull</code> next, your <code>origin/master</code> will
be updated to match origin's new <code>master</code>, then merged
into your <code>master</code> so that you have your colleague's commit
too, besides any new ones of your own. If you run <code>git pull</code>
without making any local changes, Git will update the remote-tracking
branch, and <i>fast-forward</i> your local branch to the new commit
without creating a new merge commit to record the event.

</p><p>
<img src="remerging.png" alt="Diagram of state after re-merge">

</p><h3>Merging and conflicts</h3>

<p>
If the various commits do not conflict, Git will merge them with no
intervention. Otherwise, it will merge any non-conflicting changes
automatically and ask you to resolve the remaining conflicts by hand.
Run <code>git status</code> to see which files have been merged, and
which ones need your attention. Look for <code>======</code> conflict
markers in each unmerged file, edit the surrounding text to fix the
problem, and run <code>git add <i>filename</i></code> to mark that file
as resolved. When you're done, run <code>git commit</code> to complete
the merge. See
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-merge.html"><code>git-merge(1)</code></a>
for more details.

</p><h3>Using other branches</h3>

<p>
You can create new local branches with <code>git branch
<i>branchname</i></code> and switch between branches with <code>git
checkout <i>branchname</i></code>. To push a new branch to the server,
run <code>git push origin <i>branchname</i></code>. This will create a
branch named <code>branchname</code> in origin, and
<code>remotes/origin/branchname</code> in your repository. Anyone who
then runs <code>git pull</code> will get their own pair of
remote-tracking and local branches of that name.

</p><p>
If you do not explicitly push your new local branches, they stay in your
repository and are invisible to others. <code>git push</code> by default
pushes only those branches that already exist on the server. This is why
you have to explicitly <code>git push origin master</code> the first
time you push to an empty central repository. In contrast, <code>git
pull</code> will create local copies of any new branches on the server.

</p><p>
You can also use <code>git remote</code> to add nicknames for other
repositories than <i>origin</i>. You'll get a new set of remote-tracking
branches for the new remote repository, and you will have to specify the
name as an argument to <code>git push</code> and <code>git pull</code>,
but the transfer of commits will otherwise work in exactly the same way.

</p><p>
Pulling and pushing can be much more flexible than described
here—you can specify what branches to track and update
automatically, have different local names for branches, and so on. See
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-push.html"><code>git-push(1)</code></a>
and
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-pull.html"><code>git-pull(1)</code></a>
for more.

</p><h2>Outgrowing this setup</h2>

<p>
Git offers many other workflow and configuration possibilities. Here are
a few directions to explore.

</p><p>
Use <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/githooks.html">hooks</a>
to automate tasks like sending email to the developers for every commit
or enforcing coding standards.

</p><p>
There are
<a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools#Graphical_Interfaces">graphical
frontends</a> like <a href="http://cola.tuxfamily.org/">git-cola</a> and
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/qgit/">QGit</a>, and
<a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/InterfacesFrontendsAndTools#Web_Interface">repository
browsers</a> like gitk and Gitweb (both distributed with Git). Use them
to browse history and assign blame.
Use <a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-bisect.html">git-bisect</a>
to find out which commit broke a particular test case.

</p><p>
You may eventually need to provide read-only repository access to people
outside your own team/network—set up
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/git-daemon.html">git-daemon</a>.
To give someone write access, just give them an ssh account on the
server; or install
<a href="http://github.com/sitaramc/gitolite">gitolite</a>
(the better-documented and better-maintained alternative to gitosis) for
fine-grained access control and easier user management.

</p><p>
With more users, the "everything in the master branch" model described
here may prove inadequate. There are many workflows that take
advantage of Git's easy branching and merging, such as
<a href="http://nvie.com/git-model">this nicely-illustrated one</a> and
the suggestions in
<a href="http://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git/docs/gitworkflows.html">gitworkflows(7)</a>.
Even if you adopt a more decentralised approach, you can keep using your
formerly-central repository as a fixed point of contact and for backups.
