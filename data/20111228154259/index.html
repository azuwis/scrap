<h1>Aberrant Behavior Detection in Time Series for Network Monitoring</h1>

</bigger>  <h1>Abstract</h1>
<p> The open-source software RRDtool and Cricket provide a solution to
the problem of collecting, storing, and visualizing service network
time series data for the real-time monitoring task. However,
simultaneously monitoring all service network time series of interest
is an impossible task even for the accomplished network technician.
The solution is to integrate a mathematical model for automatic
aberrant behavior detection in time series into the monitoring
software. While there are many such models one might choose, the
primary goal should be a model compatible with real-time monitoring.
At WebTV, the solution was to integrate a model based on exponential
smoothing and Holt-Winters forecasting into the Cricket/RRDtool
architecture. While perhaps not optimal, this solution is flexible,
efficient, and effective as a tool for automatic aberrant behavior
detection.
</p><h1> Introduction
</h1>
<p> Real time management of a service network infrastructure at the
IAP/ISP level is not a trivial task. First, there is the sheer
quantity of data generated on a minute-by-minute basis. The WebTV
production service infrastructure consists of tens of switches and
routers, hundreds of host computers, and thousands of application
daemon instances to support a subscriber base of over 1 million users.
Second, there is great variety in the types of data collected. The
WebTV production service monitors SNMP counters over network links,
host statistics such as CPU load and I/O operations, and event logs
for application daemons. Every variable monitored, whether byte
traffic on a switch port, CPU load of a host machine, or requests
handled by a cookie daemon, generates a time series. All of these time
series reflect some part of the overall service network health.
</p><p> The first challenge therefore, is to collect, store, and provide
real-time access to this vast and diverse data. The open-source
software RRDtool [6] and Cricket [1, 2] meet this first challenge.
Using a web browser, a network technician can quickly navigate to and
view a time series graph for a target and variable of interest.
</p><p> The network technician is likely to be interested in aberrant
behavior; that is, changes in the short-term behavior of a time series
(on the order of minutes or hours) that are inconsistent with past
history.  Long-term trends (on the order of weeks or months) are not
of interest from the service monitoring perspective because one
expects a time series to evolve in a dynamic environment. Aberrant
behavior may indicate a performance bottleneck, application component
failure, or system downtime. In some cases, aberrant behavior is
anticipated; other times it is not (see section ``Defining Aberrant
Behavior'').
</p><p> The second challenge of network monitoring is to automatically
identify aberrant behavior in the midst of thousands of service
network time series. Once such behavior is identified, an alert can be
triggered to bring the technician's attention to the potential
problem.  Existing software tools provide some of this functionality,
but these solutions usually rely on simple rules or thresholds (i.e.,
memory utilization should be below 80%). These rules and thresholds
are sufficient for many applications, but they can't detect more
subtle changes in behavior and they apply a static criteria to detect
aberrant behavior rather than a dynamic one.
</p><p> This paper describes a partial solution to this second challenge
of network monitoring at the IAP/ISP level. Section ``Description of
the Model'' discusses the aberrant behavior detection algorithm, with
a focus on understanding the algorithm parameters. The bulk of the
software implementation is in RRDtool, which is the focus of section
``Enhancements to RRDtool.'' Section ``Enhancements to Cricket''
discusses details relevant for Cricket. The conclusion lists
availability of the software.
</p><h4> Defining Aberrant Behavior
</h4>
<p> Suppose a statistical model exists that describes the behavior of
a time series (or at least the characteristics of interest). With such
a model, one can define aberrant behavior as behavior that does
conform to the model (or is not well described by the model).
</p><p> Of course, aberrant behavior with respect to a statistical model
may or may not reflect a real event of interest for the technician. In
the case that it does not, it is a false positive. Obviously, the
ideal is to minimize the rate of false positives while identifying all
events of real interest. However, this ideal can rarely be achieved.
In most detection systems, there is a trade off between selectivity
(avoiding false positives; also referred to as specificity and
precision) and sensitivity (ability to detect true positives; also
referred to as recall). While it is important to remain cognizant of
these issues, they become less important if one perceives a
statistical model for aberrant behavior as a screening mechanism
rather than a surrogate for the expert judgement of a network
technician.
</p><p> Note that this definition treats each time series independently of
all others.  No doubt there is much to be gained by leveraging the
relationships between service network variables, but that is not
addressed in this paper.
</p><h1> Description of the Model
</h1>
<h4> Model Design Goals
</h4>
<p> Many service network variable time series exhibit the following
regularities (characteristics) that should be accounted for by a
model:
</p><ul>
<li>
A trend over time (i.e., a gradual increase in application daemon
requests over a two month period due to increased subscriber load).
</li><li>
A seasonal trend or cycle (i.e., every day bytes per second increases
in the morning hours, peaks in the afternoon and declines late at
night).
</li><li>
Seasonal variability. (i.e., application requests fluctuate wildly
minute by minute during the peak hours of 4-8 pm, but at 1 am
application requests hardly vary at all).
</li><li>
Gradual evolution of regularities (1) through (3) over time (i.e., the
daily cycle gradual shifts as the number of evening daylight hours
increases from December to June).
</li></ul> This list is by no means exhaustive; but it captures the most
important characteristics.
<p> In addition to modeling time series regularities, model design
must consider the real-time monitoring context. Complicated
statistical models are unlikely to be understood by network
technicians and unlikely to be feasible computationally in a real-time
context.
</p><h4> Overview of the Model
</h4>
<p> Aberrant behavior detection is decomposed into three pieces, each
building on its predecessor:
</p><ul>
<li>
An algorithm for predicting the values of a time series one time step
into the future.
</li><li>
A measure of deviation between the predicted values and the observed
values.
</li><li>
A mechanism to decide if and when an observed value or sequence of
observed values is `too deviant' from the predicted value(s).
</li></ul>
<p> The proposed model is an extension of Holt-Winters Forecasting,
which supports incremental model updating via exponential smoothing.
The following sections discuss the model in some detail and require some
mathematical notation. Let <i>y<sub>1</sub></i> ...
<i>y<sub>t-1</sub></i>, <i>y<sub>t</sub></i>, <i>y<sub>t+1</sub></i> ...  denote the sequence of values for the time series observed at some
fixed temporal interval (recall RRDtool maps an irregular time series
to a regular interval). Let <i>m</i> denote the period of the seasonal
trend (i.e., the number of observations per day).

</p><h4> Exponential Smoothing
</h4>
<p> Exponential smoothing [3] is a simple algorithm for predicting the
next value in a time series given the current value and the current
prediction. Let
<sub><img src="15eq3.gif"></sub>
denote the predicted value for time
<i>t+1</i>, then:
<br></p><center><img src="15eq4.gif"></center>
<p> The prediction is actually a weighted average of all past
observations in the time series. The premise of exponential smoothing
is that the current value is most informative for prediction of the
next value, and that the weight of older observation decays
exponentially as the observation moves further into the past. It is an
incremental algorithm because the next prediction is obtained by
updating the current prediction with the current observed value.
</p><p> <img src="15alpha.gif"> is the model parameter and 0 &lt; <img src="15alpha.gif"> &lt; 1. It
determines the rate of decay  (1 - <img src="15alpha.gif">) and the weight the
current value is given during the incremental update.
</p><h4> The Holt-Winters Forecasting Algorithm
</h4>
<p> Holt-Winters Forecasting [3] is a more sophisticated algorithm
that builds upon exponential smoothing. Holt-Winters Forecasting rests
on the premise that the observed time series can be decomposed into
three components: a baseline, a linear trend, and a seasonal effect.
The algorithm presumes each of these components evolves over time and
this is accomplished by applying exponential smoothing to
incrementally update the components.
</p><p> The prediction is the sum of the three components:
</p><center><img src="15eq5.gif"></center>
The update formulas for the
three components, or coefficients <i>a, b, c</i> are:
<ul>
<li>
Baseline (``intercept''): <center><img src="15eq6.gif"></center>
</li><li>
Linear Trend (``slope''):  <center><img src="15eq7.gif"></center>
</li><li>
Seasonal Trend: <center><img src="15eq8.gif"></center>
</li></ul> As in exponential smoothing, the updated coefficient is an
average of the prediction and an estimate obtained solely from the
observed value <i>y<sub>t</sub></i>, with fractions determined by a model
parameter (<img src="15alpha.gif">, <sub><img src="15beta.gif"></sub>, <img src="15gamma.gif">).  Recall <i>m</i> is the period of the
seasonal cycle; so the seasonal coefficient at time <i>t</i> references the
last computed coefficient for the same time point in the seasonal
cycle.
<p> The new estimate of the baseline is the observed value adjusted by
the best available estimate of the seasonal coefficient
(<i>c<sub>t-m</sub></i>).  As the updated baseline needs to account for
change due to the linear trend, the predicted slope is added to the
baseline coefficient. The new estimate of the slope is simply the
difference between the new and old baseline (as the time interval
between observations is fixed, it is not relevant). The new estimate of
the seasonal component is the difference between the observed value and
the corresponding baseline.  </p><p> <img src="15alpha.gif">, <sub><img src="15beta.gif"></sub>, and <img src="15gamma.gif"> are the adaptation
parameters of the algorithm and 0 &lt; <img src="15alpha.gif">,
<sub><img src="15beta.gif"></sub>, <img src="15gamma.gif"> &lt; 1.
Larger values mean the algorithm adapts faster and predictions reflect
recent observations in the time series; smaller values means the
algorithm adapts slower, placing more weight on the past history of the
time series.

</p><p> Note that the update formulas imply an implementation need only to
store the current values of the slope and intercept, and a single
period of seasonal coefficients, as these stored values are replaced
at each iteration.
</p><p> Holt-Winters Forecasting can also predict a time series further
than a single time step in the future [3].  This multi-step prediction
provides a mechanism to handle missing data.
</p><h4> Confidence Bands: Measuring Deviation
</h4>
<p> Confidence bands measure deviation for each time point in the
seasonal cycle; this mechanism models seasonal variability.  The
measure of deviation is a weighted average absolute deviation, updated
via exponential smoothing:
</p><center><img src="15eq9.gif"></center>
Here <i>d<sub>t</sub></i>
is the predicted deviation at time step <i>t</i>. The update formula
for <i>d<sub>t</sub></i> is similar to that of <i>c<sub>t</sub></i>. They even
share the same adaption parameter, <img src="15gamma.gif">. The
confidence band is simply the collection of intervals
<center><img src="15eq10.gif"></center>
for each time point <i>y<sub>t</sub></i> in the series.

<p>
<sub><img src="15eq11.gif"></sub>
and
<img src="15eq12.gif">
are scaling factors for the width
of the confidence band. Often, a symmetric confidence band is desired
and <sub><img src="15eq13.gif"></sub>.  In this case, denote the common
parameter <img src="15delta.gif">.  Given some assumptions and statistical distribution
theory, sensible values of <img src="15delta.gif"> are between 2 and 3 [7].

</p><h4> Aberrant Behavior Detection
</h4>
<p> A simple mechanism to detect an anomaly is to check if an observed
value of the time series falls outside the confidence band. However,
this mechanism often yields a high number of false positives. A more
robust mechanism is to use a moving window of a fixed number of
observations [7]. If the number of violations (observations that fall
outside the confidence band) exceeds a specified threshold, then
trigger an alert for aberrant behavior.
Formally, define a violation as an observation <i>y<sub>t</sub></i> that falls
outside the interval:
</p><center><img src="15eq15.gif"></center>
Define a failure as exceeding a
specified number of threshold violations within a window of a
specified numbers of observations (the window length).
<h4> Temporal Smoothing of Seasonal Cycle and Variation
</h4>
<p> As discussed thus far, each component of the seasonal coefficients
vector is determined independently. It seems reasonable to assume that
the seasonal effect is a smooth function over the period, not a
discontinuous series of points. A similar argument applies to the
seasonal deviations. Note that exponential smoothing performs
smoothing across seasonal cycles, but does not perform temporal
smoothing within a seasonal cycle.
</p><p> At a cost of adding some additional overhead to the
implementation, the model performs temporal smoothing within a cycle
for the seasonal coefficients and deviations. The smoother used is an
equal-weight moving average, with a window of 0.05<i>m</i>.
</p><h4> Choosing Model Parameters
</h4>
<p> The model parameters need to be set and tuned for the model to
work well. There is no single optimal set of values, even restricted
to data for a single variable. This is due to the interplay between
multiple parameters in the model.
</p><p> For example, consider two observations in sequence,
<i>y<sub>t</sub></i> and <i>y<sub>t+1</sub></i>. The intercept (<i>a</i>),
slope (<i>b</i>), and seasonal (<i>c</i>) coefficients all `absorb' some
part of the difference between <i>y<sub>t</sub></i> and
<i>y<sub>t+1</sub></i> during the exponential smoothing update. It is
safe to assume some of the difference is noise, so updates to the
coefficients need not account for all of the difference between
<i>y<sub>t</sub></i> and <i>y<sub>t+1</sub></i>. The values of <img src="15alpha.gif">, <sub><img src="15beta.gif"></sub>, and <img src="15gamma.gif"> determine the relative share of the difference
assigned to a changing baseline, a changing linear trend, and a changing
seasonal coefficient.

</p><p> Here are some common sense guidelines for setting parameters:
</p><ul>
<li>
<img src="15alpha.gif">: At least one of <img src="15alpha.gif">,
<sub><img src="15beta.gif"></sub>, and <img src="15gamma.gif"> should
allow adaptation in a short time frame.  As seasonal updates occur
infrequently for each coefficient (once per cycle), and the goal of
<sub><img src="15beta.gif"></sub> is to capture a slowly changing linear
trend, the most logical choice is <img src="15alpha.gif">. Use
exponential smoothing weights to make an educated choice for <img src="15alpha.gif">. The sum of the most recent <i>n</i> weights is 1 -
(1 - <img src="15alpha.gif">)<sup><i>n</i></sup> and of course the sum
of all weights is 1 (ignoring initialization, see section
``Initialization''). These facts can be manipulated to choose <img src="15alpha.gif"> using the formula:
<center><img src="15eq16.gif"></center>

<i>log()</i> denotes the natural logarithm.  For example, if one wants
observations in the last 45 minutes to account for 95% of the weights,
and observations occur at five minute intervals (nine time points), then
the formula yields <img src="15alpha.gif"> = 0.28. This formula can be
rearranged using simple algebra to compute either the total weights as
a percentage or the number of time points (elapsed time).  For example,
if <img src="15alpha.gif"> = 0.1, then the most recent hour of
observations at five minute intervals (12 time points) accounts for 75%
of the baseline prediction.

</li><li> <sub><img src="15beta.gif"></sub>: As the purpose of <sub><img src="15beta.gif"></sub> is to capture a linear trend longer than one
seasonal cycle, it is logical to choose <sub><img src="15beta.gif"></sub> such that one seasonal cycle does not account
for a majority of the exponential smoothing weights. The formula
discussed previously applies with <sub><img src="15beta.gif"></sub>
replacing <img src="15alpha.gif">.  For example, if the period of the cycle is one day
at one observation every five minutes (288 per day), then setting
<sub><img src="15beta.gif"></sub> = 0.0024 will guarantee that observations within the last day
account for less than 50% of the smoothing weights.

</li><li>
<img src="15gamma.gif">: The seasonal adaptation parameter can also be selected using
exponential smoothing weights using a variation of the previous
formula.  Note this single parameter controls both seasonal
coefficient and deviation adaptation, on the assumption that seasonal
trend and variability evolve together over time at roughly the same
rate.
</li><li> <img src="15delta.gif">: As noted in confidence bands section, the
scaling factor of the confidence bands can be chosen by appealing to
statistical distribution theory. Reasonable values fall in the interval
[2, 3].  Choose 2 to detect more failures (which may just mean a higher
rate of false positives).

</li><li>
Window length and threshold: Given the goal of real-time monitoring,
the window length should be at most on the order of an hour (i.e., for
five minute intervals, choose a window length between 9 and 12). A
higher threshold will make the model robust to false positives, but
perhaps at the cost of missing true failures. These parameters are
probably the most difficult to set a priori.
</li></ul>

<h4> Initialization
</h4>

<p> The model requires initial values for the intercept, slope, seasonal
coefficients, and deviations (seasonal variability). These could be set
arbitrarily, computed from a long history of past data, or bootstrapped
from data as it becomes available. The implementation in RRDtool is to
bootstrap the algorithm from a cold start.  </p><p> Initial values exert
influence for some time. The analysis of exponential smoothing weights
in the previous section assumes that influence of initial values has
become negligible. For the intercept coefficient, the weight of the
initial value in exponential smoothing for observation <i>t</i> is
(1 - <img src="15alpha.gif">)<sup><i>t</i>-1</sup>.
Similar formulas hold for <sub><img src="15beta.gif"></sub> and <img src="15gamma.gif">. These formulas can
be used to calculate the influence of initial values. For example, if
the seasonal period is one day, 10 days have elapsed since
initialization, and <img src="15gamma.gif"> = 0.1, then the weight of
the initial value in the predicted seasonal coefficient is 0.39. In
contrast, the weight of the most recent observation (which in the long
run is the most influential) is only 0.1.

</p><h4> Alternatives
</h4>
<p> While the model is designed to meet several goals, it is not
optimal.  The proposed algorithm lacks a formalism found in some other
models.  It is certainly true that there is no uniformly superior
forecasting algorithm for all time series, but consider the comments
of researcher Richard Lawton [5]:
  The Holt-Winters method is one of the best known forecasting
  techniques which allows the seasonal pattern to adapt over time...
  When compared with other methods the technique has been found to
  perform relatively well and it has the merit of being understood
  by users who lack a statistical background without sacrificing the
  ability to adapt to changing patterns in the data.  <br>
</p><h1> Enhancements to RRDtool
</h1>
<p> RRD is the acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to
store and display time-series data [6]. It stores the data compactly,
minimizes I/O operations for real-time updates, and presents useful
graphs by processing the data at different temporal resolutions.
</p><p> This section describes the implementation and usage of aberrant
behavior detection in RRDtool. Some familiarity with the internals of
the current release (1.0.x) of RRDtool is assumed, as this section
makes reference to the pre-existing architecture.
</p><h4> Motivation
</h4>
<p> There are several reasons why support for aberrant behavior
detection is integrated within RRDtool, as opposed to implemented as a
standalone program. These include:
</p><ul>
<li>
Facilitates efficient real-time application of aberrant behavior
detection. An external program would have fetch data from the RRD at
the same frequency of update, while code within RRDtool is guaranteed
to operate on this data already in-memory. Efficiency is a top
priority for the service network at the IAP/ISP level, where RRDtool
can be essential part of the monitoring system of hundreds of network
interfaces and application services.
</li><li>
Leverages ability of RRDtool to perform temporal interpolation (data
updates at irregular intervals) and conversion of counters to rates.
</li><li>
Leverages the graphing capabilities of RRDtool. Graphs relevant to
aberrant behavior detection can be generated using the existing syntax
of RRDtool.
</li><li>
Leverages client software designed to run with RRDtool (i.e.,
Cricket).
</li></ul>
<h4> Architecture
</h4>
<p> On disk, the round robin database (RRD) is organized into
sequential sections, round robin archives (RRA). Within each RRA is a
section for each of the data sources (variables) stored in this RRD.
Each RRA is defined by a consolidation function which maps primary
data points (PDP) to consolidated data points (CDP). At another level,
an RRA is just an array of data values that is updated in sequence
according to some function at some fixed time interval.
</p><p> On its face, the aberrant behavior detection algorithm needs at
least two arrays, one to store the forecast values corresponding to
each primary data point, and a second to store the predicted deviation
corresponding to each PDP.  As implemented, the seasonal coefficients
and deviations that are used to calculate the forecast and predicted
deviations are stored in a second pair of RRAs. These arrays have
length equal to the seasonal period and are updated once for each PDP.
Failures are tracked by a fifth RRA, which determines violations and
failures on each update.
</p><p> The intercept and slope coefficients required for the forecast are
updated for every primary data point and are unique for each data
source. As only the most recent value of each is required (see ``The
Holt-Winters Forecasting Algorithm''), these parameters are stored in
a temporary buffer in the header allocated for each RRA-data source
combination in the RRD (the CDP buffer). This buffer is flushed back
to disk on every call to RRD update.
</p><p> The adaptation parameters are the same for all data sources within
that RRA. They are stored in the RRA parameter buffer, which is read
only during RRD update.
</p><p> Therefore, implementation of the aberrant behavior algorithm adds
five new `consolidation functions' to RRDtool
</p><ul>
<li> HWPREDICT:
an array of forecasts computed by the Holt-Winters algorithm, one for
each PDP.
</li><li> SEASONAL:
an array of seasonal coefficients with length equal to the seasonal
period. For each PDP, the seasonal coefficient that matches the index
in the seasonal cycle is updated.
</li><li> DEVPREDICT:
an array of deviation predictions. Essentially, DEVPREDICT copies
values from the DEVSEASONAL array to preserve a history; it does no
processing of its own.
</li><li> DEVSEASONAL:
an array of seasonal deviations. For each PDP, the seasonal deviation
that matches the index in the seasonal cycle is updated.
</li><li> FAILURES:
an array of boolean indicators, a 1 indicating a failure. The CDP
buffer stores each value within the window. Each update removes the
oldest value from this buffer and inserts the new observation. On each
update, the number of violations is recomputed. The maximum window
length enforced by this buffer is 28 time points.
</li></ul>
<h4> Usage
</h4>
<p> This section illustrates how to use the aberrant behavior
detection algorithm in RRDtool through an example.  The monitoring
target will be a router interface on a link between two data centers
in the WebTV production service network. The variable will be the
outgoing bandwidth rate (in Mbps). Bandwidth usage follows a daily
cycle and SNMP is polled at five minute intervals.
</p><h5> Creating a RRD file
</h5>
<p> The first step is to create a RRD for this target with aberrant
behavior detection enabled. In order to simplify the creation for the
novice user, in addition to supporting explicit creation the
HWPREDICT, SEASONAL, DEVPREDICT, DEVSEASONAL, and FAILURES RRAs, the
RRDtool create command supports implicit creation of the other four
when HWPREDICT is specified alone. To take advantage of this, use the
following syntax:
</p><pre>RRA:HWPREDICT:&lt;row count&gt;:
       &lt;alpha&gt;:&lt;beta&gt;:&lt;period&gt;
</pre>
Where:
<ul>
<li> <b>row count</b>
is the number of forecasts to store before wrap-around; this number
must be longer than the seasonal period. This value will also be the
RRA row count for DEVPREDICT RRA.
</li><li> <b>alpha</b>
is the intercept adaptation parameter, which must fall between 0 and
1.  The same value will be also be used for gamma.
</li><li> <b>beta</b>
is the slope adaptation parameter, again between 0 and 1.
</li><li> <b>period</b>
is the number of primary data points in the seasonal period. This
value will be the RRA row count for the SEASONAL and DEVSEASONAL RRAs.
</li></ul> Using this implicit creation option creates the FAILURES RRA
with a default window length of 9 and a default threshold value of 7.
The default row count of the FAILURES RRA is one period.
<p> Here is an example of the create command, using this syntax:
</p><pre>rrdtool create monitor.rrd -s 300 \
DS:ifOutOctets:COUNTER:1800:0:4294967295 \
RRA:AVERAGE:0.5:1:2016 \
RRA:HWPREDICT:1440:0.1:0.0035:288
</pre>
After creation parameters can be changed using the tune command.
RRDtool supports several new tune flags:
<pre>--alpha --beta --gamma
--window-length --failure-threshold
--deltapos --deltaneg
</pre>
Each of these flags takes a single argument that corresponds to
parameters discussed in section ``Choosing Model Parameters.'' The
<i><b>gamma</b></i> flag will reset the adaptation parameter for both
the SEASONAL and DEVSEASONAL RRAs (setting both to the same value).
Both <i><b>deltapos</b></i> and <tt>deltaneg</tt> set the scale
parameter for the upper and lower confidence band respectively, the
default value for both is 2.
<p> For example, suppose the technician is unhappy with the default
window length and threshold for the FAILURES RRA implicitly created by
the previous command. Issue the command:
</p><pre>rrdtool tune monitor.rrd \
    --window-length 5 \
    --failure-threshold 3
</pre>
The remainder of the example uses the default window length of 9 and
the default threshold of 7.
<p> Other options of the create command, including syntax and details
of the explicit creation of the new RRAs, are discussed in a detailed
implementation document [4] and the RRDtool manual [6].
</p><h5> Detecting Aberrant Behavior
</h5>
<p> The aberrant behavior detection algorithm requires nothing unusual
for the RRDtool update command; the collection mechanism (i.e.,
Cricket invoking SNMP) will run normally. Now suppose some time has
passed and the network technician is monitoring outgoing bandwidth at
the router interface. He can view a graph of daily activity, including
confidence bands and any failures, with the command in Listing 1.

<br> <center><b>Listing 1</b>: Graph generation command.<br></center>
<hr>
<p> TICK is a new graphing option in RRDtool. For every non-zero value
in the DEF or CDEF argument, it plots a tick mark. The length of the
mark (line) is specified by the third argument (after the color code)
as a decimal percentage of the y-axis. 1.0 is 100% of the length of
the y-axis, so the tick mark becomes a vertical line on the graph.

</p><p> Figure 1 is an example of this daily graph generated on Wed, May
31, 2000 for the router target described previously.  The thin lines
are the confidence bands and the vertical bars represent failures
(actually multiple failures in sequence - once the observed value
strays outside the confidence bands it remains outside the bands for
roughly a two hour period in both cases). The TICK graph option
generates the bars from the FAILURES RRA.

<center><img src="aberrant.gif"></center> <br> <center><b>Figure

<br><hr>
<p> The graph suggests that bandwidth on this outgoing link is
increasing faster than expected by the model (past history). It is up
to the network technician to decide if this represents aberrant
behavior of interest. One approach the technician might take is to
view the time series for this router interface over a longer time
period.

</p><p> With hindsight, it is easy to demonstrate something unusual is
going on and the aberrant behavior detection model is catching it in
real time.  Figure 2 is the time series for the week and half period
from May 24, 2000 to June 2, 2000.  It is clear that Wed, May 31, is
unusual. Bandwidth increases in two steps: once in the early morning
and again in the early afternoon. In this case, the dip to 0 in the
early morning hour and the subsequent jump can be attributed to a
scheduled downtime for the service network. Perhaps the remainder of
bandwidth activity on Wed has the same cause, in which case aberrant
behavior detected is a false positive in the eyes of the network
technician.

<h4> Initialization
</h4>
<p> As alluded to in the previous initialization section, the
implementation is designed to use bootstrap initialization. The
intercept coefficient is initialized to the first observed value. The
slope is initialized to 0, predicated on the assumption the linear
trend over time is close to 0.  If this is not the case, the time
required for the Holt-Winters algorithm to gravitate away from 0 will
depend on the seasonal adaptation parameter, gamma. During the first
seasonal cycle of observed values, seasonal coefficients are
initialized. During the second seasonal cycle of observed values,
seasonal deviations are initialized.  Unknown values during the first
two seasonal cycles can complicate initialization. Basically, the
implementation initializes any coefficients it can at the earliest
opportunity; refer to the detailed implementation document [4].
</p><h1> Enhancements to Cricket
</h1>
<p> Cricket is a front-end to RRDtool [1, 2]. Cricket manages multiple
time series via RRDtool in a target configuration hierarchy. The
configuration hierarchy (or config tree) is a flexible approach to
grouping targets with common time series variables, graphing
characteristics, and other properties. The Cricket collector provides
built-in and extensible mechanisms for gathering data and feeding it
to RRDtool. The collector manages SNMP calls and reads application
event logs. The Cricket grapher generates time series graphs using the
capabilities of RRDtool in real-time and serves them up as web pages.
The graphs are organized via directory pages generated to match the
config tree.
</p><h4> Monitoring
</h4>
<p> RRDtool has no mechanism for raising alerts, while Cricket does.
Cricket provides several types of monitor-thresholds, which are
defined in the config tree in a <i><b>target dictionary</b></i>
section. Each monitor-threshold entry can contain multiple monitors.
The basic functionality of a Cricket monitor-threshold is to fetch the
most recent value from one of the RRAs of the target RRD file, check
some criteria, and take some user-defined action if the criteria
fails.
</p><p> For efficiency and simplicity, Cricket 1.1 includes a new type of
monitor-threshold specific for aberrant behavior detection. This
monitor, <i><b>failures</b></i>, joins the existing Cricket monitors
<i><b>relation</b></i>, <i><b>value</b></i>, and <i><b>hunt</b></i>.
The general Cricket 1.1 monitor-threshold syntax permits a comma-
delimited list of monitors.  The syntax of each monitor is:
</p><pre>&lt;data source&gt;:&lt;monitor type&gt;:
  &lt;monitor args&gt;:&lt;action&gt;:&lt;action args&gt;
</pre>
The <i><b>failures</b></i> monitor does not take any arguments. For
example, to send an SNMP trap whenever a failure is recorded for the
ifOutOctets data source used in the example, the network technician
adds the following entry to the appropriate target dictionary section:
<pre>my-monitor-threshold =
     "IfOutOctets:failures::SNMP"
</pre>
Note that currently in Cricket 1.1, SNMP actions do not require any
arguments, but the tag <i><b>trap-address</b></i> must be defined in
the <i><b>target</b></i> dictionary.  This may change in the future as
Cricket 1.1 is still under development.
<p> The <i><b>failures</b></i> monitor searches for a FAILURES RRA in
the RRD file for the specified data source and if successful fetches
the most recent value. If this value is 1, indicating a failure, it
triggers the specified action. Through this mechanism, a network
technician can easily be notified when the algorithm identifies
something of interest.
</p><p> Note that while the aberrant behavior detection RRAs, if created,
apply to all data sources in the RRD file, the monitoring mechanism
can be enabled for specific data sources or none at all.
</p><h4> HTML Navigation Links
</h4>
<p> Given the complexity of the RRDtool graph command, the Cricket 1.1
implementation provides a simple mechanism to view graphs relevant to
aberrant behavior detection.
</p><p> Cricket generates HTML navigation links to graphs using the new
RRAs if it detects the string `HoltWinters' in the name of the view.
The view must consist of a single data source that is not multi-
target. It verifies these restrictions before enabling the navigation
links.  There are three navigation links added:
</p><ul>
<li> Confidence Bounds:
displays the target data source using the Hourly Time Range with upper
and lower confidence bands. The confidence band scaling factor (delta)
cannot be obtained directly from the RRD file. Specify this factor
with the <i><b>confidence-band-scale</b></i> tag in the graph
dictionary. The default value (if the tag is omitted) is 2.
</li><li> Failures:
displays the target data source with prospective failures marked with
vertical yellow lines (or yellow bars for failures in sequence) using
the Hourly Time Range.
</li><li> Confidence Bounds and Failures:
the combination of the both of the preceding graphs.
</li></ul>
<h1> Conclusion
</h1>
<p> There is a need to meet the second challenge of networking
monitoring: automatic aberrant behavior detection. The model and
software outlined here are a solid approach to the problem, working
within the architecture of the existing open-source solutions RRDtool
and Cricket.  There is ample room for future work, especially in a
solution that exploits not only the past history of a service network
variable, but the relationships between service network variables.
